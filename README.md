# Special-Forces-Rotations

This repo is meant to be a community-managed collection of rotation templates to use with the Special Forces BHUD module.

### **IMPORTANT: This project has been put on hold until the module gets updated to avoid any issues when the new UI comes out**

Templates are sorted by profession

## Currently There are Builds for:
- Snowcrows Ele Builds
- Snowcrows Guardian Builds
- Snowcrows Necro Builds

## How to Use:
- Click on the folder of the profession you want to find a rotation for
- Click on one of the builds you want to use
- Copy the code after `Rotation Template`
- Open Special Forces module, click "Import from Clipboard"

## How to Contribute:
- Clone the repo
- Create your own branch
- Copy-paste the template file into the profession folder for your build
- Rename the copied file according to the template
- Update the file template, save
- Make the commit, push it, then create a pull request

Alternatively: Message nulll#7146 on discord with the required fields and I will add it to the repo
